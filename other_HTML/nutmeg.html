  <h2>Nutmeg</h2>
  <img src="/images/sadikka1.jpeg" alt="">
<p>From ancient times, Nutmeg has been a most prized spice. There is some evidence to support the claim that the Roman priests may have burned nutmeg as a form of incense. It is also believed to have been used as a prized and costly spice in medieval cuisine, used as flavourings, medicines, preserving agents and that was at the time highly valued in the European markets.</p>

<P>
Up to the 19th Century, nutmeg was only grown in Banda Islands or Spice Islands in Eastern Indonesia, which also served as an entrepot destination for cloves. Just like with Sri Lanka, the successful spice trade in the Banda Islands led to bloody wars between the colonial powers who were fighting over the Asian spice trade.
